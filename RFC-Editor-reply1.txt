Most readers will have no intuition about why "traffic patterns that mimic TCP"
is important or how it is different.

Consider:
   Mathematical TCP models are used to determine Traffic parameters and
   subsequently to design traffic patterns that mimic TCP 
   (which is bursty at multiple time scales) or other
   transport protocol delivering bulk data and operating at the Target
   Data Rate, MTU and RTT over a full range of conditions.

Yes, definitely clearer.

"to test against (criteria)" is proper statistics terminology in wide use.

"etc" is not needed.  Isn't this a sentence fragment too?

Yes, although e.g. implies the existence of other resources as well.  The
only cases I can construct are rather contrived.

Correct.

I note the proposed also has a hyphenation change that looks a bit odd to
me: "transport- and lower-level headers".   Both "transport level" and 
"lower level" are in common usage, but "level headers" is not, so prior
text does not introduce any ambiguity.

IP rate and IP capacity are less pedantic forms of the well known
concepts defined pedantically in RFC5136 as IP-type-P Link Usage and
IP-type-P Link Usage Capacity.

Perhaps "same as ... in".  Using the full 5136 language would make
some of the text here even more opaque.  The additional precision would
not improve clarity.

Yes!

No because observed clashes with expected.

This is technically correct but in my mind, does not improve clarity.

Good catch!
I think this should be "four-packet paced bursts".  It is a direct reference
to the previous definition, but specifying a burst size (4 packets) and an
average rate.

Note that section 6.1 covers this in more detail.  While the descriptions here
are accurate as far as they go they are not pedantically complete.  Making them
complete would make the text opaque.  I thought very hard about how to get the
right level of detail here.

Yes although e.g. might be better because there are other events that
have the same effect as "stops reading or writing data" but different
underlying causes.   Both make the necessary point.

It sounds fine to me....?  The issue is that non-realistic applications
(e.g. diagnostics or test applications) may not exhibit authentic pauses.

No, consider:
   It is known that these bursts can hurt network
   performance, especially in conjunction with other queue pressure;
   however we are not aware of any models for estimating the impact nor prescribing
   limits on the size or frequency of sender rate bursts.

Perhaps this is better, but "given RTT" and "given MTU" aren't sufficiently 
connected to the complete path, also the causality is sort of backwards.
The logic should be:
- Pick the path
- observe RTT and MTU
- confirm observed RTT less than or equal to the Target RTT
- confirm observed MTU greater than or equal to the Target MTU
- then it is expected ....

I wrestled with this paragraph quite a bit and haven't been able to make
it clear.

Yes, but perhaps more words would help:
   When there is a slowly rising standing queue at the bottleneck
   the onset of packet loss has to be at an appropriate point (time
   or queue depth) and progressive, for example by use of Active
   Queue Management [RFC7567].

half-duplex link would correct

Proposed:
   When there is a standing queue at a bottleneck for a shared media
   subpath (e.g. a half-duplex link), there must be a suitable bounds on
   the interaction between ACKs and data, for example due to the
   channel arbitration mechanism.  See Section 8.2.4.

@@@@ Al I am at a loss here: RFC7312 mentions "packet History" but
does not prescribe methodologies or even terminology.

Consider:
   Examples include: the presence or non-presence of cross
   traffic on specific subpaths; negotiating ECN; and failing to
   construct appropriate packet histories as needed to put
   reactive network elements into the specified states [RFC7312].

Math slang
How about
   Since the required run length is proportional to the square of the data rate, at
   higher rates, the run lengths can be unreasonably large, and multiple
   flows might be the only feasible approach.

RFC 5827 is better (The problem that RFC4015 is trying to fix is largely

Yes, I prefer:
This test confirms...
This engineering test confirms... 
This capacity test confirms... 

Note that while most tests can clearly be classified as one of engineering or
capacity, there are a few that might be either, particularly tests that are

The bullets clash with the descriptions of all of the other tests, since
they all have the same form: send some pattern; accumulate statistics.
(Alternatively change *all* of the test descriptions to bulleted lists.)

Can we use the words but not the layout:
    This is a capacity test to confirm that slowstart is not likely to
    exit prematurely.  To perform this test send slowstart bursts that
    are target_window_size total packets and accumulate packet transfer
    statistics as described in Section 7.2 to
    score the outcome.  Pass if it is statistically significant that the
    observed number of good packets delivered between losses or ECN CE
    marks is larger than the target_run_length.  Fail if it is
    statistically significant that the observed interval between losses
    or ECN CE marks is smaller than the target_run_length.

Missed edit after renaming some of the tests.   It should have been:

   Note that these are the same parameters as the Sustained Bursts Test
   (Section 8.5.1) except the burst rate is at slowstart rate, rather than
   sender interface rate.

However this raises a minor point about section 8.5.1: It probably should have
been titled "Sustained Full Rate Bursts Test".  This would be a more accurate
description.  The section name is not referenced except in the TOC and the
fragment above.   Is this a permitted change at this stage?

This clashes with other test descriptions.   Would semicolons help?

Something like:
    To perform this test: Do a continuous slowstart
    (send data continuously at twice the
    implied IP bottleneck capacity), until the first loss; stop and allow
    the network to drain and repeat; gathering statistics on how many
    packets were delivered before the loss, the pattern of losses,
    maximum observed RTT and window size.  Justify the results.

Semicolons again?   Also I a surprised that you did not flag "simply".

Perhaps (quoting more of the original):

   The sustained burst test implements a combined worst case version of
   all of the capacity tests above.  To perform this test:
   send target_window_size bursts of packets at server interface rate
   with target_RTT burst headway (burst start to next burst start);
   verify that the observed packet transfer statistics meets the
   target_run_length.

That is exactly what the rest of the paragraph does....?  Does this help:

   Under the above constraints the serving_window_clamp will limit the
   both the serving data rate and burst sizes to be smaller or equal to
   the parameters specified by the procedures
   in Section 8.1.2 and Section 8.4 or Section 8.5.1.

Consider:

   that most content is within a 50 mS RTT of their users

The second "the ISP" could be "they determine"

"This section" would be ok, except does that mean Section 9 or 9.1?

How about:

Consider:
   Note that it is
   important that a single tightly constrained environment just barely
   passes all tests, otherwise there is a chance that TCP can exploit
   extra latitude in some parameters (such as data rate) to partially
   compensate for constraints in other parameters (e.g. queue space).
   This effect is potentially by-directional: extra latitude in the
   queue space tests has the potential to enable TCP to compensate
   for insufficient data rate headroom.

Although I am not sure that the extra sentence improves the overall
clarity.

Measurement Point.

NPAD (Network Path and Application Diagnostics) for the only use.
It was an NSF project name.

Network Interface Card, however that clashes with the only use.
Consider just expanding it in place:

At some point we deliberately made the language in the abstract a little less
technical jargon and more generically descriptive.   This was for two reasons:
avoiding using language long before it is defined in the document; and
a general prohibition against introducing acronyms in abstracts.  If neither
of these matter, make it technical jargon.

A more correct expansion would be "metrics produced by the IPPM working group"
The M and metrics only appears to collide because the entire phrase is an

Long Fat Network was really a pun on Long Fast Network (used in RFC 1072 and

and using "fat".

I would go with Constant Window Pseudo CBR.  "Pseudo" is important, but

It think it should be plural bursts.
