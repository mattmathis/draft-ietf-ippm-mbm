This document is targeting Experimental, but I did see 

   It may seem out of place to allow such latitude in a measurement
   standard, but this section provides offsetting requirements.
   
in Appendix A, which seems to say this is a standard. Perhaps that could be reworded?
[ACM,MM] yes, done

Starting at the beginning ...

Is "key infrastructure" "critical infrastucture"? I'm sure I've been reading far too many SEC documents lately, but I immediately assumed this was a reference to something like PKI :-)
[ACM,MM] DONE

Is "interconnects" something like "network interconnections"? If that's a term of art, fine, but I wonder how clear that is to non-native English readers.
[ACM] proposing "internetwork gateways"
[MM] You missed a handful in section 9.  I have reconsidered, and am using Spenser's term "network interconnections", DONE

The first sentence in the Introduction, 
   Model Based Metrics (MBM) rely on peer-reviewed mathematical models
   to specify a Targeted Suite of IP Diagnostic tests, designed to
   assess whether common transport protocols can be expected to meet a
   predetermined Target Transport Performance over an Internet path.
provided a LOT of information I didn't get out of the Abstract. Maybe it would be helpful there, too (we're told that people still publish Abstracts of RFCs without the body of the document).
[ACM,MM] I put this sentence as the second paragraph of Abstract, DONE

[ACM] INTRO comments start

It's a nit, but 
   The temporal
   structure of the test streams mimic transport protocol behavior over
   the complete path, the statistical criteria models the transport
   protocol's response to less than ideal IP packet transfer.
seems like a run-on sentence. Maybe split into two sentences at the comma, or use a semicolon?
[ACM,MM] semicolon I think... DONE

I often see reviewers comment on references to "in the future" and "Today" in RFCs that live forever. I think you can just drop "in the future" from 
   In the future,
   other Model Based Metrics may cover other applications and
   transports, such as VoIP over UDP and RTP, and new transport
   protocols.
[ACM,MM] dropped the phrase. DONE  
but you might want to search for at least those terms in the document.
[ACM] see sections 5.4, 6.0, and 8.4 for other occurrences 
[MM] Removed all about future technology.  Only remaining uses of explicit "future" are about docuemtns. DONE
 
[ACM] OVERVIEW

This text
   (One group of tests, the standing queue tests described in
   Section 8.2, don't correspond to existing IPPM metrics, but suitable
   metrics can be patterned after the existing definitions.)
was passive enough that I don't know whether you're talking about IPPM developing new metrics, or about something else (perhaps work that developers will do on their own). If you mean what I think you mean, just changing to "suitable new IPPM metrics" would be clear to me, but I'm guessing.
[ACM,MM] suggest8ion workd for me.  DONE

In Figure 1, I was confused by the distinction between "fail/inconclusive" and "pass/fail/inconclusive". Maybe not for the document, but could you educate me? I think I understand that you have to do Delivery Evaluation to determine "pass/fail/inconclusive", and the description of Section 8 further down the Overview confirmed what I was thinking here, but I'm not understanding what "fail/inconclusive" is telling me about traffic pattern generation, unless it's something like "failed due to configuration errors" (and that's a guess, based on text at the end of Section 4.2).
[ACM] labelled these as test status and test result.
[MM] Tweaked to "traffic generation status" DOME

I had to read 
   Since the statistical criteria are typically for the
   complete path (a composition of subpaths) [RFC6049]
a couple of times to parse "typically for". Is this saying 
   Since the statistical criteria typically apply to the
   complete path (a composition of subpaths) [RFC6049]
?
[ACM,MM] Yes, that's better wording. DONE

"HD video" is probably clear enough for now, but expanding "HD" on first use might be helpful for readers in the future.

[ACM,MM] Terminology DONE

<AD whining>
The more I read, the more I found the mixed forms permitted in
   Note that terms containing underscores (rather than spaces) appear in
   equations in the modeling sections.  In some cases both forms are
   used for aesthetic reasons, they do not have different meanings.
confusing. When "test path:", with no underscores, is immediately followed by "test_path_RTT:", with underscores, the usage looks entirely random to the first-time reader, and there are some formulas that use the form with no underscores, that don't stand out as formulas on first reading ("2*target_window_size" is obviously a mathematical expression, but without underscores, it would be less obvious). I'm hesitant to suggest that you make a global change to use underscores during AD Review because that seems really likely to introduce errors, but I really wish I'd said that earlier in the process. Do the right thing.
</AD whining>
[ACM] this would be a major edit
[MM] will think about this.  My sense is that it will make the text rather ugly.  STILL OPEN  

"Bulk Transport Capacity" appears in the definition of "Target Transport Performance" before the definition of "Target Data Rate" where the term "BTC" first appears, but "Bulk Transport Capacity (BTC)" in the first case would have helped me figure out "BTC" on its first use in the document.
[ACM,MM] Done (nit)

It's a nit, but s/able meet the target performance/able to meet the target performance/.
[ACM,MM] Done

I wasn't sure who was assuming a 1500 Byte MTU when, in this text. 
   Target MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit):  The specified maximum MTU
      supported by the complete path the over which the application
      expects to meet the target performance.  Assume 1500 Byte MTU
      unless otherwise specified.
Did that mean "in this document", or "when testing", or something else?
[ACM] When testing, IMO.
[MM] I went with "in this document" DONE (nit)

I even know what "type-p" is in this text,
   Fully Specified Targeted IP Diagnostic Suite (FS-TIDS):  A TIDS
      together with additional specification such as "type-p", etc which
      are out of scope for this document,
but you could usefully provide a reference for that, and I'm not sure whether "out of scope for this document" means that they exist in other documents. I think you're saying that, but I'm not sure.
[ACM] yes, that's it.
@@@@@@@@
In this text,

   Bulk Transport Capacity:  Bulk Transport Capacity Metrics evaluate an
      Internet path's ability to carry bulk data, such as large files,
      streaming (non-real time) video, and under some conditions, web
      images and other content

How would the reader know what conditions make these metrics applicable to web images and other content?

[ACM] There is a relationship, but the ability to deliver Web
      and images is mostly based on RTT (small file size)

"Terminology about paths, etc.  See [RFC2330] and [RFC7398]." is really terse. Do you mean that the list of terms following this are taken from these RFCs, or are you saying the reader should be aware of other terms defined in those RFCs that don't appear in that list of terms? Or is that just a header for the list of terms following? I started wondering that when I saw "Properties determined by the complete path and application.  These are described in more detail in Section 5.1." further down the page, and had the same question.

[ACM] Added "for existing terms and definitions" in the terminology about paths
      section.

In this text,

      Since TCP
      derives its clock from the data delivered through the bottleneck
      the front path must have sufficient buffering to absorb any data
      bursts at the dimensions (duration and IP rate) implied by the ACK
      stream, potentially doubled during slowstart.
      
is "doubling each RTT" more accurate here? And if you included a reference for slowstart, that would likely be helpful to some readers. It appears a bunch of times in the document, but RFC 5681 isn't referenced until much later than the terminology section. 

@@@@@  [ACM] I think this is explained later. ??
            (and potentially twice the buffer to absorb overshoot in slowstart)

It's a nit, but s/moderns servers/modern servers/.

[ACM]  found and fixed

I'm struggling with 

   Window [size]:  The total quantity of data plus the data represented
      by ACKs circulating in the network is referred to as the window.
      See Section 4.1. 
      
and I think it's because I don't understand the scope of "the total quantity of data". Does this need a qualifier? A bit further down, "pipe size" and "target_window_size" talk about "packets in flight (the window size)", which further confused me. Is that window size the same that's being defined here?

@@@@ [ACM] Yes, I think "packets in flight" needs to be added in the right place

"a more stringent TIDS validation procedures" needs help with a numbering mismatch.

@@@@ [ACM] I think Section 10 is correct

"By default the bursts are assumed full sender interface rate" is really hard to parse.

@@@@ [ACM] "assumed to occur at full..."

In this text,

   Monitoring tests:  Monitoring tests are designed to capture the most
      important aspects of a capacity test, but without presenting
      excessive ongoing load themselves.  As such they may miss some
      details of the network's performance, but can serve as a useful
      reduced-cost proxy for a capacity test, for example to support
      ongoing monitoring.
      
does "ongoing monitoring" mean "during engineering testing", or something else? 
[ACM] it means "continuous production network monitoring" IMO.

[ACM]  Background section 4 -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

In this text,

   At the time the IPPM WG was chartered, 
   
I THINK thats something like 

   In 2006, when the IETF begain work on performance measurement,
   
which tells the reader the timeframe (I had to look - 2006 is the oldest charter in the datatracker) and removes a reference to a working group that is long-lived, but may conclude SOME day.

[ACM] IPPM started-out sharing a meeting slot with BMWG, in 1997. 

There's a "and or" with no "/" between them.
[ACM] ok

I suspect that the earlier Section 4.1 appears in the document, the clearer the document would be, within limits ... I learned things, and I imagine most readers would benefit from learning them before piling into the terminology section that uses these concepts freely.

@@@@ [ACM] This is worth considering Matt, but it's a tricky task with the
            sections in separate files. Same is suggested for 4.3.

SCTP is mentioned once in the document, 17 pages in. Is it worth being more explicit whether this document applies to specific protocols besides TCP? Much of the discussion is either "TCP" or "throughput maximizing protocols", SCTP is only mentioned once, and of course I wondered about DCCP ... 

[ACM] I remember reading "and other transport protocols" in earlier sections,
so I think we're covered.

This text

   We are developing a tool that can perform many of the tests described
   here [MBMSource].

   The tool that can perform many of the tests described
   here is available from [MBMSource].
   
?
[ACM] ok

I suspect that moving Section 4.3 earlier in the document would also be helpful.

@@@@ [ACM]  also consider with the move above.

[ACM] comments jump to section 5.2 (need to find the file)
This text,

   To exactly fill the pipe, losses must be no
   closer than when the peak of the AIMD sawtooth reached exactly twice
   the target_window_size otherwise the multiplicative window reduction
   triggered by the loss would cause the network to be underfilled.
   Following [MSMO97] the number of packets between losses must be the
   area under the AIMD sawtooth. 
   
looks like a run-on sentence, and it's impressively long. I'd suggest splitting it.
[ACM] it is two sentences, but can use a little work.

"a fully specified TIDS or FSTIDS" looks like two things, but it's the same thing with two names, isn't it?
[ACM] yes, (or FS-TIDS) should do it. 

-=-=-=-=-=-=- STOPPED -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I don't think

   o  The TIDS or FSTIDS MUST document and justify the actual method
      used to compute the derated metric parameters.
      
is an RFC 2119 MUST (and the next two bullets have lower-case "must"s, so that makes me wonder if all three should match, either way).

   Test preconditions and failure actions MUST be specified in a FSTIDS.
   
doesn't seem like a 2119 MUST, either.

   At some point in the future it may make sense to introduce fine
   grained noise sources into the models used for generating test
   streams, but they are not warranted at this time.

I'm not getting 

   TCP slowstart has a two level burst structure as shown in Figure 2.
   
from looking at 

   time ==>    ( - equals one packet)
   Packet stream:

   ----  ----  ----  ----  ----                     ----  ---- ...

   |<>| sender interface rate bursts (typically 3 or 4 packets)
   |<===>| burst headway (determined by ACK headway)
   |<========================>| slowstart burst size(from the window)
   |<==============================================>| slowstart headway
   \____________ _____________/                     \______ __ ...
                V                                          V
         One slowstart burst                   Repeated slowstart bursts

   Multiple levels of Slowstart Bursts

                                 Figure 2

which doesn't use the word "level", and the next sentence

   The fine structure is caused by the interaction between the ACK clock
   and TCP efficiency algorithms.
   
refers to "fine structure", which doesn't appear in the figure, either. Is that a term of art? I'm seeing

   This
   fine structure defines one slowstart rate burst.
   
further down, but that's using "fine structure" to define something else, not defining "fine structure". I'm also seeing "finest time scale", but it's only used once - is that related?

I'm pretty sure that making the text match the labels in the Figure is all that's needed, but I'm only understanding the current text by guessing.

The scope of "transport protocol" in 

   For a transport protocol the slowstart bursts are repeated every
   target_RTT.
   
is really broad. Does this mean "TCP" (or, see my previous note about explicitly describing the transport protocols that this document applies to).

In this text,
   Also cross
   traffic potentially raises the RTT, implicitly reducing the rate.
   Cross traffic that raises the RTT nearly always makes the test more
   strenuous.
I don't know whether a more strenuous test is better or worse. Is that a term of art? If not, could this be clearer?
[MM] @@@@@

I think "a constant window CBR tests" needs help with a numbering mismatch.
[MM] nit DONE

It's a nit, but 
   There are a number of reasons to want to specify performance in term
   of multiple concurrent flows, 
needs s/in term/in terms/.
[MM] nit DONE

I wasn't quite sure how to read 
   There are a number of reasons to want to specify performance in term
   of multiple concurrent flows, however this approach is not
   recommended for data rates below several megabits per second, which
   can be attained with run lengths under 10000 packets on many paths.
   Since the required run length goes as the square of the data rate, at
   higher rates the run lengths can be unreasonably large, and multiple
   flows might be the only feasible approach.
It says "not recommended", but if I'm understanding this correctly, are you saying it's not necessary? Is the point that at a high enough data rate, you really do need multiple concurrent flows, but until then, you can fill the path without using them?
[MM] Yes, this is what I am saying.

Here is an allegory: Using multiple streams on an ordinary path is much like choosing a to drive a jeep in every day life.  The ride is always bad, but potholes don't matter so much.  If you standardize testing with a jeep you might come to the concluding that pavement is overrated and we should save tax payer money by just going back to gravel.

This is akin to the discussion about reordering: How do we draw a line between the problems that should be fixed in the network (reasonable quality) and the problems should be fixed in the stack (not requiring an obscenely low loss rate).

If somebody decides that any path over 1 Mb/s should be channelized, then we will be implicitly giving people permission to build truly crappy networks.

I wish there was a way to say this that did not imply an Internet wide design scale.
(No text changes at this time).
>>>> discuss with Spencer

Is 
   For the tests that use bursty test streams, the bursts should be
   synchronized across streams.
because you're trying to ensure that if the bursts DID become synchronized, the path can still meet Target Transport Performance? It might be helpful to provide an explanation for this recommendation.
[MM] I made the false pass condition explicit. DONE

(As much for Spencer as for the authors and shepherd) I really like 
   Note that transport retransmission strategies can trade off
   reordering tolerance vs how quickly they can repair losses vs
   overhead from spurious retransmissions.  In advance of new
   retransmission strategies we propose the following strawman:
   Transport protocols should be able to adapt to reordering as long as
   the reordering extent is not more than the maximum of one quarter
   window or 1 mS, whichever is larger.  Within this limit on reorder
   extent, there should be no bound on reordering density.
and wish that it was more visible to the Internet community than it will be, 40 pages into this document. Please feel free to leave it here, but could we talk about how to make that happen? Seeing what the feedback is during approval for this document will tell us how much agreement there is about the strawman ...
[MM] Thanks - no doc changes.   I have always wanted to revert the Juniper M160 debacle, which had a huge opportunity cost for the entire Internet by implicitly banning cheap sharded routing engines.  The above language had that language in mind (e.g. it choose a position on reordering that would probably have been met by the M160.
In 
   For some technologies the data might not be subject to increasing
   delays, 
I didn't understand what "data might not be subject to" meant. I was guessing that this was a reference to senders that don't notice increasing delays, assume that's bufferbloat building up buffer occupancy, and decrease sending rate, but I was guessing.

I note that

helped me understand that you meant "derate" as a calculation, and not just a SWAG. It appears really late in the document, and could usefully appear in the definition of "derate" in the terminology section.
[MM] added "Models can be derated by including a multiplicative derating factor to make tests less stringent." to the definition DONE

I don't think
   Model Based Metrics can be implicitly implemented as a side effect
   any non-throughput maximizing application, such as streaming media,
