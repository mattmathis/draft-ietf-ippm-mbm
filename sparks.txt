DONE use Xr

> The document starts using 2119 MUSTs in section 7.3. None of the uses

> Please rewrite the prose without using the 2119 keywords.

DONE (Also dropped 2119 reference, etc)

> Section 8.2.4 seems to be missing an actual description/definition of
> the test it is trying to talk about.

DONE

> The abstract says this document does not define tests. The rest of the

DONE - reworded abstract

> document avoids, but does not suppress.

DONE suppress -> avoids

> At the end of section 1, you call out "multiple standardized versions
> of
> TCP". Please clarify what you're trying to point to?

DONE Removed the incomplete thought.

> In the definition of "traffic patterns", you note that the goal is to
> "mimic the range of common patterns". Consider qualifying that to
> "current common patterns", and add some discussion later in the
> document when you talk about pregenerating traffic patterns to point
> out that these change over time.

NOT DONE

> At the next to last paragraph of section 4.1, you say "metrics have
> entirely thwarted the analytic framework". I don't think that's what
> you mean. I suspect you mean to say attempts to create metrics have
> been unsuccessful (I suggest you avoid the word "thwarted").

DONE 

> At the 3rd paragraph on page 19, you say "There is no model". Do you
> mean no model exists in the world for this, or only that this document
> does not provide a model.

DONE

DONE

DONE

DONE

??? "Engineering test" is defined in section 3, before it is used.

> - There are several places where you talk about tests being

Neither.
