      title="Basic Data Rate and Packet Transfer Tests">

        <t>We propose several versions of the basic data rate and
        packet transfer statistics test that differ in how the
	data rate is
        controlled. The data can be paced on a timer, or window
        controlled (and self clocked). The first two tests
        implicitly confirm that sub_path has sufficient raw
        capacity to carry the target_data_rate. They are recommended
        for relatively infrequent testing, such as an installation
        or periodic auditing process. The third, background packet
        transfer statistics, is a low rate test designed for
        ongoing monitoring for changes in subpath quality.</t>
