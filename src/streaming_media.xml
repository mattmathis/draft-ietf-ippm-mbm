          <t>Model Based Metrics can be implicitly implemented as a
          side effect any non-throughput maximizing application,
          such as streaming media, with some additional controls
          and instrumentation in the servers. The essential
          requirement is that the data rate be constrained such
          that even with arbitrary application pauses and bursts
          the data rate and burst sizes stay within the envelope
          defined by the individual tests described above.</t>

          <t>If the application's serving_data_rate is less than or
          equal to the target_data_rate and the serving_RTT (the
          RTT between the sender and client) is less than the
          target_RTT, this constraint is most easily implemented by
          clamping the transport window size to be no larger
          than:</t>

          <t>
          serving_window_clamp=target_data_rate*serving_RTT/(target_MTU-header_overhead)</t>

          <t>Under the above constraints the serving_window_clamp
          will limit the both the serving data rate and burst sizes
          to be no larger than the procedures in 
          <xref target="windowed_rate" /> and 
          <xref target="sender_rate" /> or 
          <xref target="sustained_burst" />. Since the serving RTT
          is smaller than the target_RTT, the worst case bursts
          that might be generated under these conditions will be
          smaller than called for by 
          <xref target="sender_rate" /> and the sender rate burst
          sizes are implicitly derated by the serving_window_clamp
          divided by the target_window_size at the very least.
          (Depending on the application behavior, the data might be
          significantly smoother than specified by any of the burst
          tests.)</t>

          <t>In an alternative implementation the data rate and
          bursts might be explicitly controlled by a programmable
          traffic shaper or pacing at the sender. This would
          provide better control over transmissions but it is
          substantially more complicated to implement and would be
          likely to have a higher CPU overhead.</t>

          <t>Note that these techniques can be applied to any
          content delivery that can be subjected to a reduced data
          rate in order to inhibit TCP equilibrium behavior.</t>
