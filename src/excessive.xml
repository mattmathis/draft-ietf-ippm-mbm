          <t>This test confirm that the onset of loss is not
          excessive. Pass if losses are equal or less than the
          increase in the cross traffic plus the test stream window
          increase on the previous RTT. This could be restated as
          non-decreasing subpath throughput at the onset of loss,
          which is easy to meet as long as discarding packets is
          not more expensive than delivering them. (Note when there
          is a transient drop in subpath throughput, outside of a
          standing queue test, a subpath that passes other queue
          tests in this document will have sufficient queue space
          to hold one RTT worth of data).</t>

          <t>Note that conventional Internet policers will not pass
          this test, which is correct. TCP often fails to come into
          equilibrium at more than a small fraction of the
          available capacity, if the capacity is enforced by a
          policer. [Citation Pending].
