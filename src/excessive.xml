          <t>This test confirms that the onset of loss is not
          excessive. Pass if losses are equal or less than the
          increase in the cross traffic plus the test stream window
          increase since the previous RTT. This could be restated as
          non-decreasing total throughput of the subpath at the onset of loss.
          (Note that when there
          is a transient drop in subpath throughput and there is
	  not already a 
          standing queue, a subpath that passes other queue
          tests in this document will have sufficient queue space
          to hold one full RTT worth of data).</t>

          <t>Note that token bucket
	  policers will not pass this test, which is as intended.
	  TCP often stumbles badly if more than a small fraction
	  of the packets are dropped in one RTT.
	  Many TCP implementations will require a timeout and
	  slowstart to recover their self clock.
	  Even if they can recover from the massive losses the
	  sudden change in available capacity
	  at the bottleneck wastes serving and front path capacity
	  until TCP can adapt to the new
	  rate <xref target="Policing" />.
