          <t>A subpath passes the congestion avoidance standing
          queue test if more than target_run_length packets are
          delivered between the onset of queuing (as determined by
          the window with the maximum network power as described
	  above) and the first
          loss or ECN CE mark. If this test is implemented using a
          standard congestion control algorithm with a clamp, it
          can be performed in situ in the production internet as a
          capacity test. For an example of such a test see 
          <xref target="Pathdiag" />.</t>

          <t>For technologies that do not have conventional queues,
          use the test_window in place of the onset of queuing.
          i.e. A subpath passes the congestion avoidance standing
          queue test if more than target_run_length packets are
          delivered between start of the scan at test_window and
          the first loss or ECN CE mark.</t>
