      <t>Since some aspects of the models are likely to be too
      conservative, 
      <xref target="models" /> permits alternate protocol models and
      
      <xref target="derate" /> permits test parameter derating. If
      either of these techniques are used, we require
      demonstrations that such a TIDS can robustly detect subpaths
      that will prevent authentic applications using
      state-of-the-art protocol implementations from meeting the
      specified Target Transport Performance. This correctness
      criteria is potentially difficult to prove, because it
      implicitly requires validating a TIDS against all possible
      paths and subpaths. The procedures described here are
      still experimental.</t>

      <t>We suggest two approaches, both of which should be
      applied: first, publish a fully open description of the TIDS,
      including what assumptions were used and and how it was
      derived, such that the research community can evaluate the
      design decisions, test them and comment on their
      applicability; and second, demonstrate that applications
      do meet the Target Transport Performance when
      running over a network testbed which has the tightest
      possible constraints that still allow the tests in the TIDS to pass.</t>

      <t>This procedure resembles an
      epsilon-delta proof in calculus. Construct a test network
      such that all of the individual tests of the TIDS pass by
      only small (infinitesimal) margins, and demonstrate that a
      variety of authentic applications running over real TCP
      implementations (or other protocols as appropriate) meets the
      Target Transport Performance over such a network. The
      workloads should include multiple types of streaming media
      and transaction oriented short flows (e.g. synthetic web
      traffic).</t>

      <t>For example, for the HD streaming video TIDS described in 
      <xref target="examples" />, the IP capacity should be exactly
      the header_overhead above 2.5 Mb/s, the per packet random
      background loss ratio should be 1/363, for a run length of
      363 packets, the bottleneck queue should be 11 packets and
      the front path should have just enough buffering to withstand
      11 packet interface rate bursts. We want every one of the
      TIDS tests to fail if we slightly increase the relevant test
      parameter, so for example sending a 12 packet burst should
      cause excess (possibly deterministic) packet drops at the
      dominant queue at the bottleneck. This network has the tightest
      possible constraints that can be expected to pass the TIDS,
      yet it should be possible for a real application
      using a stock TCP implementation in the vendor's default
      configuration to attain 2.5 Mb/s over an 50 mS path.</t>

      <t>The most difficult part of setting up such a testbed is
      arranging for it to have the tightest possible constraints
      that still allow it to pass the individual
      tests. Two approaches are suggested: 
      constraining (configuring) the network devices not
      to use all available resources (e.g. by limiting available
      buffer space or data rate); and pre-loading subpaths with
      cross traffic. Note that is it important that a single
      tightly constrained environment just barely passes all
      tests, otherwise there is a chance that TCP
      can exploit extra latitude in some parameters (such as data
      rate) to partially compensate for constraints in other
      parameters (queue space, or vice-versa).</t>

      <t>To the extent that a TIDS is used to inform public dialog
      it should be fully publicly documented, including the details
      of the tests, what assumptions were used and how it was
      derived. All of the details of the validation experiment
      should also be published with sufficient detail for the
      experiments to be replicated by other researchers. All
      components should either be open source of fully described
      proprietary implementations that are available to the
      research community.</t>
