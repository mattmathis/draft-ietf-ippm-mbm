          <t>This engineering test confirms a bound on the
          interactions between the forward data path and the ACK
          return path.</t>

          <t>Some historical half duplex technologies had the
          property that each direction held the channel until it
          completely drained its queue. When a self clocked
          transport protocol, such as TCP, has data and ACKs
          passing in opposite directions through such a link, the
          behavior often reverts to stop-and-wait. Each additional
          packet added to the window raises the observed RTT by two
          packet times, once as it passes through the data path,
          and once for the additional delay incurred by the ACK
          waiting on the return path.</t>

          <t>The duplex self interference test fails if the RTT
          rises by more than a fixed bound above the expected
          queueing time computed from trom the excess window
          divided by the subpath IP Capacity. This bound must be
          smaller than target_RTT/2 to avoid reverting to stop and
          wait behavior. (e.g. Data packets and ACKs both have to
          be released at least twice per RTT.)</t>
