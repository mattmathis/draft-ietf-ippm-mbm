      <t>Model Based Metrics (MBM) rely on peer-reviewed mathematical models to
      specify a Targeted Suite of IP Diagnostic tests, designed to
      assess whether common transport protocols can be expected to
      meet a predetermined Target Transport Performance over an
      Internet path. This note describes the modeling framework to
      derive the test parameters for accessing an Internet path's
      ability to support a predetermined Bulk Transport
      Capacity.</t>

      <t>Each test in the Targeted IP Diagnostic Suite (TIDS)
      measures some aspect of IP packet transfer needed to meet the
      Target Transport Performance. For Bulk Transport Capacity the
      TIDS includes IP diagnostic tests to verify that there is:
      sufficient IP capacity (data rate); sufficient queue space at
      bottlenecks to absorb and deliver typical transport bursts;
      and that the background packet loss ratio is low enough not
      to interfere with congestion control; and other properties
      described below. Unlike typical IPPM metrics which yield
      measures of network properties, Model Based Metrics nominally
      yield pass/fail evaluations of the ability of standard
      transport protocols to meet the specific performance
      objective over some network path.</t>

      <t>In most cases the IP diagnostic tests can be implemented
      by combining existing IPPM metrics with additional controls
      for generating test streams having a specified temporal
      structure (busts or standing queues, etc) and statistical
      criteria for evaluating packet transfer. The temporal
      structure of the test streams mimic transport protocol
      behavior over the complete path, the statistical criteria
      models the transport protocol's response to less than ideal
      IP packet transfer.</t>

      <t>This note describes an alternative to the approach
      presented in "A Framework for Defining Empirical Bulk
      Transfer Capacity Metrics" 
      <xref target="RFC3148" />. In the future, other Model Based
      Metrics may cover other applications and transports, such as
      VoIP over RTP.</t>

      <t>The MBM approach, mapping Target Transport Performance to
      a Targeted IP Diagnostic Suite (TIDS) of IP tests, solves
      some intrinsic problems with using TCP or other throughput
      maximizing protocols for measurement. In particular all
      throughput maximizing protocols (and TCP congestion control
      in particular) cause some level of congestion in order to
      detect when they have filled the network. This self inflicted
      congestion obscures the network properties of interest and
      introduces non-linear equilibrium behaviors that make any
      resulting measurements useless as metrics because they have
      no predictive value for conditions or paths different than
      that of the measurement itself. These problems are discussed
      at length in 
      <xref target="background" />.</t>

      <t>A Targeted IP Diagnostic Suite does not have such
      difficulties. IP diagnostics can be constructed such that
      they make strong statistical statements about path properties
      that are independent of the measurement details, such as
      vantage and choice of measurement points. Model Based Metrics
      are designed to bridge the gap between empirical IP
      measurements and expected TCP performance.</t>
