      <t>Measurement is often used to inform business and policy
      decisions, and as a consequence is potentially subject to
      manipulation. Model Based Metrics are expected to be a huge
      step forward because equivalent measurements can be performed
      from multiple vantage points, such that performance claims
      can be independently validated by multiple parties.</t>

      <t>Much of the acrimony in the Net Neutrality debate is due
      to the historical lack of any effective vantage independent
      tools to characterize network performance. Traditional
      methods for measuring Bulk Transport Capacity are sensitive
      to RTT and as a consequence often yield very different
      results when run local to an ISP or interconnect and when
      run over a customer's complete path. Neither the ISP nor
      customer can repeat the others measurements, leading to high
      levels of distrust and acrimony. Model Based Metrics are
      expected to greatly improve this situation.</t>

      Fully Specified Targeted IP Diagnostic Suite. Each FS-TIDS
      MUST include its own security section.</t>
