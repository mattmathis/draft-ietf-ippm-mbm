      <t>We introduce a new class of Model Based Metrics designed
      to assess if a complete Internet path can be expected to meet
      a predefined Target Transport Performance by applying a suite
      of IP diagnostic tests to successive subpaths. The
      subpath-at-a-time tests can be robustly applied to critical
      infrastructure, such as network interconnections or even individual
      devices, to accurately detect if any part of the
      infrastructure will prevent paths traversing it from meeting
      the Target Transport Performance.</t>

      <t>Model Based Metrics rely on mathematical models
      to specify a Targeted Suite of IP Diagnostic tests, designed to
      assess whether common transport protocols can be expected to meet a
      predetermined Target Transport Performance over an Internet path.</t>

      <t>For Bulk Transport Capacity the IP diagnostics are built
      using test streams and
      statistical criteria for evaluating the packet transfer
      that mimic TCP over the complete path.
      The temporal structure of the
      test stream (bursts, etc) mimic TCP or other transport
      protocol carrying bulk data over a long path.  However they are
      constructed to be independent of the details of the subpath
      under test, end systems or applications. Likewise the success
      criteria evaluates the packet transfer statistics of the
      subpath against criteria determined by protocol performance
      models applied to the Target Transport Performance of the
      complete path. The success criteria also does not depend on
      the details of the subpath, end systems or application.</t>
