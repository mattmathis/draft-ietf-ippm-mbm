          <t>This engineering test confirms a bound on the
          extent to which Channel Acquisition between the
	  forward data path and the ACK return path interferes
	  with self clocked transport protocols, such as TCP.</t>

          <t>Some historical half duplex technologies had the
          property that each direction held the channel until it
          completely drained its queue. When a self clocked
          transport protocol has data and ACKs
          passing in opposite directions through such a link, the
          behavior often reverts to stop-and-wait. Each additional
          packet added to the window raises the observed RTT by two
          data packet times, once as it passes through the data path,
          and once due to the additional delay incurred by the ACK
          waiting on the return path.</t>

          <t>The duplex self interference test fails if stop-and-wait
          behavior is present at window sizes equal to or larger than
          the target_window_size/2.  If stop-and-wait behavior is not
          present this window should cause the RTT to rise to no more
          than the target_RTT/2.  If stop-and-wait behavior is present
          the RTT will rise to approximatly the target_RTT.

during a
	  standing queue test the observed RTT
          rises above the test_path_RTT by more than a fixed bound

more than the larger
	  of target_RTT/2 or a documented fixed bound determined by
	  the channel 

above the expected
          queuing time computed from the excess window
          divided by the subpath IP Capacity. This bound must be
          smaller than target_RTT/2 to avoid reverting to stop and
          wait behavior. (e.g. Data packets and ACKs both have to
          be released at least twice per RTT.)</t>
