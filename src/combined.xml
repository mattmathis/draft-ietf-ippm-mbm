        <t>Combined tests efficiently confirm multiple network
        properties in a single test, possibly as a side effect of
        normal content delivery. They require less measurement
        traffic than other testing strategies at the cost of
        conflating diagnostic signatures when they fail. These are
        by far the most efficient for monitoring networks that are
        nominally expected to pass all tests.</t>
