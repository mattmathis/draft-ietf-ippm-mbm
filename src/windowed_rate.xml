          <t>Confirm that the observed run length is at least the
          target_run_length while sending at an average rate
          approximately equal to the target_data_rate, by
          controlling (or clamping) the window size of a
          conventional transport protocol to a fixed value computed
          from the properties of the test path, typically
          test_window=target_data_rate*test_path_RTT/target_MTU.
          Note that if there is any interaction between the forward
          and return path, test_window may need to be adjusted
          slightly to compensate for the resulting inflated RTT.
          However see the discussion in 
          <xref target="self_interference" />.</t>

          <t>Since losses and ECN CE marks cause transport
          protocols to reduce their data rates, this test is
          expected to be less precise about controlling its data
          rate. It should not be considered inconclusive as long as
          at least some of the round trips reached the full
          target_data_rate without incurring losses or ECN CE
          marks. To pass this test the network MUST deliver
          target_window_size packets in target_RTT time without any
          losses or ECN CE marks at least once per two
          target_window_size round trips, in addition to meeting
          the run length statistical test.</t>
