          <t>The background run length is a low rate version of the
          target target rate test above, designed for ongoing
          lightweight monitoring for changes in the observed
          subpath run length without disrupting users. It should be
          used in conjunction with one of the above full rate tests
          because it does not confirm that the subpath can support
          raw data rate.</t>

          <t>RFC 6673 
          <xref target="RFC6673" /> is appropriate for measuring
          background packet transfer statistics.</t>
