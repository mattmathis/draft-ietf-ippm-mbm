      title="Constant window pseudo CBR">

        <t>Implement pseudo constant bit rate by running a standard
        self clocked protocol such as TCP with a fixed window size.
	If that window size is test_window, the data rate will be
	slightly above the target_rate.</t>

        <t>Since the test_window is constrained to be an integer
        number of packets, for small RTTs or low data rates there
        may not be sufficiently precise control over the data rate.
        Rounding the test_window up (as defined above) is likely to
        result in data rates that are higher than the target rate,
        but reducing the window by one packet may result in data
        rates that are too small. Also cross traffic potentially
        raises the RTT, implicitly reducing the rate. Cross traffic
        that raises the RTT nearly always makes the test more
        strenuous (more demanding for the network path).</t>

        <t>Note that Constant window pseudo CBR (and Scanned window
        pseudo CBR in the next section) both rely on a self clock
        which is at least partially derived from the properties of the
        subnet under test.  This introduces the possibility that the
        subnet under test exhibits behaviors such as extreme RTT
        fluctuations that prevent these algorithms from accurately
        controlling data rates.</t>
	
	<t>
        A FS-TIDS specifying a constant window CBR test
        must explicitly indicate under what conditions errors in
        the data rate cause tests to be inconclusive.
	Conventional paced
	measurement traffic may be more appropriate for these
	environments. </t>
