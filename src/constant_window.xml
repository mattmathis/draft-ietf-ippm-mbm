      title="Constant window pseudo CBR">

        <t>Implement pseudo constant bit rate by running a standard
        self clocked protocol such as TCP with a fixed window size.
	If that window size is test_window, the data rate will be
	slightly above the target_rate.</t>

        <t>Since the test_window is constrained to be an integer
        number of packets, for small RTTs or low data rates there
        may not be sufficiently precise control over the data rate.
        Rounding the test_window up (the default) is likely to
        result in data rates that are higher than the target rate,
        but reducing the window by one packet may result in data
        rates that are too small. Also cross traffic potentially
        raises the RTT, implicitly reducing the rate. Cross traffic
        that raises the RTT nearly always makes the test more
        strenuous (more demanding for the network path). 
        A FS-TIDS specifying a constant window CBR test
        MUST explicitly indicate under what conditions errors in
        the data rate cause tests to inconclusive.</t>

        <t>Since constant window pseudo CBR testing is sensitive to
        RTT fluctuations it will be less accurate at controlling the data
        rate in environments with fluctuating delays.  Conventional paced
	measurement traffic may be more appropriate for these
	environments. </t>
