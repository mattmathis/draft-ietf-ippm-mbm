        <t>Implement pseudo constant bit rate by running a standard
        protocol such as TCP with a fixed window size, such that it
        is self clocked. Data packets arriving at the receiver
        trigger acknowledgements (ACKs) which travel back to the
        sender where they trigger additional transmissions. The
        window size is computed from the target_data_rate and the
        actual RTT of the test path. The rate is only maintained in
        average over each RTT, and is subject to limitations of the
        transport protocol.</t>

        <t>Since the window size is constrained to be an integer
        number of packets, for small RTTs or low data rates there
        may not be sufficiently precise control over the data rate.
        Rounding the window size up (the default) is likely to be
        result in data rates that are higher than the target rate,
        but reducing the window by one packet may result in data
        rates that are too small. Also cross traffic potentially
        raises the RTT, implicitly reducing the rate. Cross traffic
        that raises the RTT nearly always makes the test more
        strenuous. A FSTIDS specifying a constant window CBR tests
        MUST explicitly indicate under what conditions errors in
        the data rate causes tests to inconclusive.</t>

        <t>Since constant window pseudo CBR testing is sensitive to
        RTT fluctuations it is less accurate at controling the data
        rate in environments with fluctuating delays.</t>
