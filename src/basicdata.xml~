      title="Basic Data Rate and Packet Transfer Tests">

        <t>We propose several versions of the basic data rate and
        packet transfer statistics test. All measure the number of
        packets delivered between losses or ECN Congestion
        Experienced (CE) marks, using a data stream that is rate
        controlled at or below the target_data_rate.</t>

        <t>The tests below differ in how the data rate is
        controlled. The data can be paced on a timer, or window
        controlled at full Target Data Rate. The first two tests
        implicitly confirm that sub_path has sufficient raw
        capacity to carry the target_data_rate. They are recommend
        for relatively infrequent testing, such as an installation
        or periodic auditing process. The third, background packet
        transfer statistics, is a low rate test designed for
        ongoing monitoring for changes in subpath quality.</t>

        <t>All rely on the data receiver accumulating packet
        transfer statistics as described in 
        <xref target="statistics" /> to score the outcome:</t>

        <t>Pass: it is statistically significant that the observed
        interval between losses or ECN CE marks is larger than the
        target_run_length.</t>

        <t>Fail: it is statistically significant that the observed
        interval between losses or ECN CE marks is smaller than the
        target_run_length.</t>

        <t>A test is considered to be inconclusive if it failed to
        meet the data rate as specified below, meet the
        qualifications defined in 
        <xref target="qualifications" /> or neither run length
        statistical hypothesis was confirmed in the allotted test
        duration.</t>
        <section title="Delivery Statistics at Paced Full Data Rate">


          <t>Confirm that the observed run length is at least the
          target_run_length while relying on timer to send data at
          the target_rate using the procedure described in in 
          <xref target="paced" /> with a burst size of 1 (single
          packets) or 2 (packet pairs).</t>

          <t>The test is considered to be inconclusive if the
          packet transmission can not be accurately controlled for
          any reason.</t>

          <t>RFC 6673 
          <xref target="RFC6673" /> is appropriate for measuring
          packet transfer statistics at full data rate.</t>
