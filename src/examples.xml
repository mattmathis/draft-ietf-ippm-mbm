    <section anchor="examples" title="An Example">

      <t>In this section a we illustrate a TIDS designed to confirm
      that an access ISP can reliably deliver HD video from
      multiple content providers to all of their customers. With
      modern codecs, minimal HD video (720p) generally fits in 2.5
      Mb/s. Due to their geographical size, network topology and
      modem designs the ISP determines that most content is within
      a 50 mS RTT from their users (This is a sufficient to cover
      continental Europe or either US coast from a single serving
      site.)</t>

      <t>Table 1 shows the default TCP model with no derating, and
      as such is quite conservative. The simplest TIDS would be to
      use the sustained burst test, described in 
      <xref target="sustained_burst" />. Such a test would send 11
      packet bursts every 50mS, and confirming that there was no
      more than 1 packet loss per 33 bursts (363 total packets in
      1.650 seconds).</t>

      <t>Since this number represents is the entire end-to-end loss
      budget, independent subpath tests could be implemented by
      apportioning the packet loss ratio across subpaths. For
      example 50% of the losses might be allocated to the access or
      last mile link to the user, 40% to the interconnects with
      other ISPs and 1% to each internal hop (assuming no more than
      10 internal hops). Then all of the subpaths can be tested
      independently, and the spatial composition of passing
      subpaths would be expected to be within the end-to-end loss
      budget.</t>
      <!-- @@@@ move to conclusion? -->

      <t>Testing interconnects has generally been problematic:
      conventional performance tests run between measurement points
      adjacent to either side of the interconnect, are not
      generally useful. Unconstrained TCP tests, such as iperf 
      <xref target="iperf" /> are usually overly aggressive because
      the RTT is so small (often less than 1 mS). With a short RTT
      these tools are likely to report inflated numbers because for
      short RTTs these tools can tolerate very high packet loss
      ratios and can push other cross traffic off of the network.
      As a consequence they are useless for predicting actual user
      performance, and may themselves be quite disruptive. Model
      Based Metrics solves this problem. The same test pattern as
      used on other subpaths can be applied to the interconnect.
      For our example, when apportioned 40% of the losses, 11
      packet bursts sent every 50mS should have fewer than one loss
      per 82 bursts (902 packets).</t>
