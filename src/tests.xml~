    <section anchor="tests" title="IP Diagnostic Tests">

      <t>The IP diagnostic tests below are organized by traffic
      pattern: basic data rate and packet transfer statistics,
      standing queues, slowstart bursts, and sender rate bursts. We
      also introduce some combined tests which are more efficient
      when networks are expected to pass, but conflate diagnostic
      signatures when they fail.</t>

      <t>There are a number of test details which are not fully
      defined here. They must be fully specified in a FSTIDS. From
      a standardization perspective, this lack of specificity will
      weaken this version of Model Based Metrics, however it is
      anticipated that this it be more than offset by the extent to
      which MBM suppresses the problems caused by using transport
      protocols for measurement. e.g. non-specific MBM metrics are
      likely to have better repeatability than many existing BTC
      like metrics. Once we have good field experience, the missing
      details can be fully specified.</t>
