      <section anchor="qualifications" title="Test Preconditions">

        <t>Many tests have preconditions which are required to
        assure their validity. Examples include: the presence or
        non-presence of cross traffic on specific subpaths;
        negotiating ECN; and appropriate preamble packet stream 
        to testing to put reactive
        network elements into the proper states 
        <xref target="RFC7312" />. If preconditions are not
        properly satisfied for some reason, the tests should be
        considered to be inconclusive. In general it is useful to
        preserve diagnostic information as to why the preconditions
        were not met, and any test data that was collected even if
        it is not useful for the intended test. Such diagnostic
        information and partial test data may be useful for
        improving the test or test procedures themselves.</t>

        <t>It is important to preserve the record that a test was
        scheduled, because otherwise precondition enforcement
        mechanisms can introduce sampling bias. For example,
        canceling tests due to cross traffic on subscriber access
        links might introduce sampling bias in tests of the rest of
        the network by reducing the number of tests during peak
        network load.</t>

        <t>Test preconditions and failure actions must be specified
        in a FS-TIDS.</t>
