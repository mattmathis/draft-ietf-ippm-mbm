          <t>Confirm that the observed run length is at least the
          target_run_length while relying on timer to send data at
          the target_rate using the procedure described in in 
          <xref target="paced" /> with a burst size of 1 (single
          packets) or 2 (packet pairs).</t>

          <t>The test is considered to be inconclusive if the
          packet transmission can not be accurately controlled for
          any reason.</t>

          <t>RFC 6673 
          <xref target="RFC6673" /> is appropriate for measuring
          packet transfer statistics at full data rate.</t>
