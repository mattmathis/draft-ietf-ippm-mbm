<abstract><t>This memo presents recommendations to the Internet community concerning measures to improve and preserve Internet performance.  It presents a strong recommendation for testing, standardization, and widespread deployment of active queue management (AQM) in network devices to improve the performance of today's Internet.  It also urges a concerted effort of research, measurement, and ultimate deployment of AQM mechanisms to protect the Internet from flows that are not sufficiently responsive to congestion notification.</t><t>Based on 15 years of experience and new research, this document replaces the recommendations of RFC 2309.</t></abstract>
