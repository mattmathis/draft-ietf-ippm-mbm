Apologies for the delayed reply, hope this is not too late. I think
the points that would be most helpful for understanding section 7.2
are:

- The hypothesis test models packet transmissions as Bernoulli
  processes, which assumes packet loss probabilities are independent
  and identically distributed (i.i.d.).

- Second, the hypothesis test approximates individual packet loss
  probabilities using the link's loss rate (the count of "lost"
  packets over count of total packets sent). This also assumes that
  packet loss probabilities are i.i.d..

- (Ultimately though, my understanding is that the measurement we are
  interested in is not the packet loss probability, but the frequency
  of "decrease window size events.")

- The rate of false PASSes/FAILs depends not only on the specified
  acceptable Type I and Type II error rates, but also on the
  probability cutoff used in the alternate hypothesis, the value of
  which was chosen "[b]ased on analysis of typical values and
  practical limits on measurement duration".

- Also, to reiterate the purpose of this hypothesis test - this
  hypothesis test does not estimate the value of the packet loss rate,
  but only whether or not the packet loss rate is likely "low enough"
  (when we accept the null hypothesis; PASS), or "too high" (when we
  accept the alternate hypothesis; FAIL).

Please let me know if you have any questions and/or comments!
